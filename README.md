About the Project
This project is a React-based web application that leverages Three.js to deliver a modern, interactive experience. At its core, the application showcases a rotating 3D iPhone model as a loader, symbolizing creativity and technical precision. It’s designed to provide developers with an example of integrating advanced 3D animations into a responsive, production-ready web app.

This project serves as both a portfolio piece and a boilerplate for incorporating Three.js into other projects.

Core Features
3D Loader: A rotating iPhone model appears during page transitions or while content loads.
Responsive Design: Adjusts seamlessly across devices, including mobile, tablet, and desktop.
Reusable Components: Modular and reusable structure for scalability.
Production-Ready: Optimized for deployment on platforms like Vercel.
Interactive UI: Smooth transitions and visually appealing animations.
Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js
3D Animations: Three.js, @react-three/drei
Styling: Tailwind CSS
Deployment: Vercel
