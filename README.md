## **About the Project**

This project is a **React-based web application** that uses **Three.js** to deliver a modern, interactive experience. At its core, it features a **rotating 3D iPhone model as a loader**, demonstrating creative use of 3D models and animations in a web context.

It‚Äôs designed as both a portfolio piece and a boilerplate for developers aiming to integrate **Three.js** into production-ready web applications.
